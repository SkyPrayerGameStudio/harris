==RLE1==
Research: Large Engines (1)
The development of truly heavy bombers is thought to require new
engines in the 2,000hp class.  Various ideas including the 'X' (or
twinned vee) configuration and the 'sleeve valve' will be tested in
these new designs.

==RLE2==
Research: Large Engines (2)
The development of truly heavy bombers is thought to require new
engines in the 2,000hp class.  The Rolls-Royce Vulture X24 engine,
consisting of two V12 Peregrines on a common crankshaft, is under
development as is the Bristol Hercules sleeve-valve radial.

==RLE3==
Research: Large Engines (3)
The development of truly heavy bombers is thought to require new
engines in the 2,000hp class.  The Rolls-Royce Vulture and Bristol
Hercules are being developed for the Avro Manchester and Short
Stirling heavy bomber proposals, while uprated Rolls-Royce Merlins
are needed for Handley Page's four-engined Halifax design.  These
complex engines are also likely to require the addition of a new
'flight-engineer' position to bomber crews.

==TFE==
Training: Flight Engineer
The complex engines of modern heavy bombers require the attention of
a skilled flight-engineer crew member.  By developing up-to-date
training methods for these airmen, they will be able to improve the
performance of the aircraft in speed, range and height as well as
being more effective at damage control when hit by enemy fire.

==AEH==
Aircraft: Early Heavies
The prototypes of two heavy bomber designs begun in the pre-war
years, the twin-engined Avro Manchester and the large four-engined
Short Stirling, require only a little more development work to
become ready for operational service.

==ALANC==
Aircraft: Project BT308
Avros have proposed the conversion of Manchester serial BT308 into a
prototype of their "Manchester III" design with four Rolls-Royce
Merlin engines and an increased wingspan.

==AMosq==
Aircraft: Mosquito
The de Havilland company's prototype Mosquito, the unarmed wooden
bomber with fighter speed, has shown considerable promise in test
flights and an operational production version can now be put into
development.

==DBBB==
Development: Bulged Bomb Bay
While slightly spoiling the de Havilland Mosquito's clean lines, it
is thought that this proposal to enable the aircraft to carry the
4,000lb High Capacity bomb will not materially affect the aircraft's
performance.

==D2SM==
Development: Two-Stage Merlin
Rolls-Royce believe that the use of a two-stage supercharger in
their Merlin engines, increasing the power at high altitude, will
allow unprecedented performance.  The first proposed application of
these new engines is in the de Havilland Mosquito.

==ALU==
Aircraft: Lancaster Upgrade
By combining two-stage Merlins with other improvements to the
armament and equipment of the Avro Lancaster, this classic heavy
bomber can be further 'stretched' to improve speed, height, payload,
survivability and reliability in the Mark X version.  Some of these
developments can also be retrofitted to existing Mark I airframes.

==DGL==
Development: Gransden Lodge
By modifying the tail turret of the Avro Lancaster I to improve the
gunner's night vision, this aircraft's ability to survive against
nightfighter attack can be improved.

==ASB==
Aircraft: Supermarine's Bomber
The Supermarine firm, famous for their Spitfire fighters, have been
working on a four-engined heavy bomber, the Type 317, for some time.
Though delayed through a combination of technical difficulties and
the effects of an enemy bombing raid on the company's factory, it
can still be developed and brought into operational service.

==AH1==
Aircraft: Halifax I
The four-engined Handley Page Halifax, currently at the prototype
stage, is ripe for development into an operational bomber type.

==DHU==
Development: Halifax Upgrades
The problems which have been experienced with the Halifax I in
operational use can, fortunately, be corrected or at least mitigated
if effort is spent on developing modifications to the aircraft.
This research will also open the way to an improved version of the
Halifax design at a later date.

==AH3==
Aircraft: Halifax III
Both rugged and reliable, the Bristol Hercules and Handley Page
Halifax are a perfect match for one another.  Combined with a
redesigned tailplane, the proposed Mark III variant is hoped to be
this war's "bloody paralyser of an aeroplane".

==RBC1==
Research: Bristol Centaurus (1)
The Bristol company are developing a new radial engine to follow
their Hercules.  Named the Centaurus, it seems likely to finally
attain the magic '2,000hp' figure, and several bomber firms are
interested in the possibilities.

==RBC2==
Research: Bristol Centaurus (2)
The 2,000-plus horsepower Bristol Centaurus needs only a little more
work to reach reliability and serviceability levels sufficient for
its use in operational bomber aircraft.  The most favoured proposal
for its use is from Short Bros for an even larger development of
their four-engined Stirling.

==ASSt==
Aircraft: Super Stirling
Short Bros describe their proposal as the "Super Stirling": with
four Centaurus radial engines mounted on a new 135-foot wing, the
new bomber would have an eight-ton payload while retaining the good
handling characteristics of the Stirling.  Most of that aircraft's
serviceability issues can also, it is thought, be resolved.

==AVW==
Aircraft: Vickers Windsor
A pressurised cockpit is the most notable feature of Vickers' new
Windsor heavy bomber design.  Combined with high-blown engines, this
high-altitude aircraft should have good survivability while
delivering a heavy seven-ton payload over a long range.

==ASW==
Aircraft: Stretched Whitley
The Armstrong-Siddeley Deerhound engine provides a possible way to
keep the old Whitley bomber competitive.  The improved performance
should make the proposed Armstrong-Whitworth Elswick less vulnerable
than its predecessor to enemy action.  The payload can also be
slightly increased, by 500lb or so.

==DAI==
Development: Armament Improvements
The armament on several of our medium bombers is proving distinctly
inadequate to meet the threat of enemy fighter aircraft.  Proposals
to improve this have been submitted by Bristol, Handley Page and
Vickers for their Blenheim, Hampden and Wellington bombers.  Much of
this work will also be applicable to the later heavy bomber types.

==DSST==
Development: Self-Sealing Tanks
A major cause of bomber losses is the vulnerability of the fuel
tanks to flak and fighter attack.  By fitting self-sealing tanks it
is hoped that this can be significantly reduced, allowing many more
bombers (and their crews!) to make it home.

==DVR==
Development: Vulture Reliability
With the pressures of Merlin development for fighters beginning to
relax slightly, Rolls-Royce believe they can solve many of the
problems that plague the Vulture engine, hopefully allowing the Avro
Manchester to live up to its promise.

==TNN==
Training: Night Navigation
As our pre-war plans mainly centred around daylight bombing, the
switch to night attack has left us without effective means of
training aircrew in the art of night-time air navigation.  A new
programme of training is needed to remedy this and enable our bomber
aircraft to find their targets.

==TP==
Training: Pilot
Flying the new four-engined heavy bombers is very different to the
light and medium 'fighting bombers' to which our existing pilot-
training programme is geared.  Developing new methods for 'heavy
conversion' will make our pilots more effective at tasks ranging
from evasive manoeuvres to getting the best performance out of the
aircraft.

==RRE1==
Research: Radio Electronics (1)
Advances in thermionic valves and lightweight electronics have made
possible the invention of several promising ideas for the use of
radio waves in the navigation of aircraft.  Notions like hyperbolic
navigation and airborne radar join beam bombing in the potential
applications of radioelectronics to the bomber offensive.

==RRE2==
Research: Radio Electronics (2)
Advances in thermionic valves and lightweight electronics have made
possible the invention of several promising ideas for the use of
radio waves in the navigation of aircraft.  With a little more basic
research we can open the way to detailed design of the first
generation of distance-measuring navaids; some scientists also
believe that means of generating oscillations in the centimetric
wavelength range are just around the corner.

==DEN==
Development: Early Navaids
Two new radionavigation aids are currently at the prototype stage.
The 'GEE' hyperbolic navigation system and the 'OBOE' blind-bombing
aid both rely on distance measurement by means of timed pulses of
radio waves from ground stations.  While their range is thus limited
by the curvature of the Earth, nonetheless the accuracy achievable
should revolutionise night bombing.

==DGH==
Development: Gee-H
By combining the best elements of both OBOE and GEE, the 'reverse
transponder' system of the proposed new Gee-H radionavigational aid
will allow highly accurate bombing by a large number of aircraft at
the same time (in theory up to 100 per pair of ground stations),
thus avoiding the biggest limitation of the OBOE system.

==RCR1==
Research: Centimetric Radar (1)
Though currently only at the laboratory prototype stage, the new
cavity magnetron valves invented at Birmingham University, capable
of generating centimetric radio waves, promise a great leap in RDF
technology, in particular miniaturising it for airborne use.

==RCR2==
Research: Centimetric Radar (2)
Further development of the centimetric RDF possibilities of the
cavity magnetron will give us a great lead over the Germans in
electronic technologies.  One application of these devices may be in
terrain-mapping RDF units small enough to carry in aircraft.

==DW==
Development: Window
Now that our own RDF systems are advanced far beyond the Germans',
the Government have at last authorised the use of parasitic radio
reflectors, codenamed 'Window', to be dropped from bombers to jam
the enemy's RDF systems, both ground-based and airborne.

==DH2S==
Development: H2S
An airborne terrain-mapping RDF unit is now a practical possibility
for use in heavy bombers.  Codenamed 'H2S', this bit of electronic
wizardry will allow crews to 'see' ground features such as towns and
rivers even on the blackest and cloudiest nights, making accurate
navigation possible even beyond the range of OBOE.

==DFP==
Development: Fishpond
It has been noticed that H2S can produce returns from aircraft
flying below the bomber.  While these are not displayed on the main
screen (which starts drawing at a distance equal to the aircraft's
altitude), by adding a second unit (codenamed 'Fishpond') to show
these returns, the approach of enemy nightfighters (which commonly
attack from below) may be detected.

==DBS==
Development: Bomb Sights
Replacing the old Course Setting Bomb Sight with a new stabilised,
vector-computing bomb sight will allow crews to bomb more accurately
while reducing the need for a long, straight (hence vulnerable) run.

==TBA==
Training: Bomb Aimer
With the use of new technologies like the H2S radionavigation aid
and the Mark XIV bomb sight, bomb-aiming is now a specialised skill,
requiring new methods of training to reach the high standards that
the RAF desires.  For some aircraft bomb-aimers will also be trained
in gunnery as they operate front turrets when not over the target.
