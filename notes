fighter methods

start-KAMMHUBER:
Fighters are deployed to cover targets that seem threatened.

KAMMHUBER-TAMEBOAR:
Fighters are deployed to /Himmelbett/ zones and other sited Würzburgs.

TAMEBOAR-end:
Nightfighters are deployed to where the bomber stream is headed and subsequently rely on airborne radar.  Dayfighters use Wild Boar (cover targets that seem threatened).


idea - achievements
Certain things, when achieved, have a propaganda value, and can consequently be used to argue for more bombers.  For instance: the first hundred-bomber raid; the first thousand-bomber raid; the first bombload to fall on the German mainland; the first bombload to fall on Berlin; the first target to be destroyed; the first city to be destroyed.  Each of these achievements should trigger an increase in the budget.


idea: running costs (ties in to e.g. squadrons&bases, the latter would cost some amount to build too)
According to Bomber Squadron At War, it cost £3,000/week just to feed everyone at RAF Ludford Magna.  Building the station cost £800,000.


idea: marks.  Mods that are only applied to new production.  Stirling III.
